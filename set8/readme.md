live coding
incredibly engaged
dictionary - no repetition (key and values to define thing)
types defining the dictionary (strings)
keys are strings
everything has one value, which is a collection of data
treat them as list

use the with function to open another file (with open(file_path,mode,encoding="utf-8")) as history book)

utf-8 encoding lets you use more character sets within code
.read() file in a single string
.readline() read the first line
.readlines() reads all lines as a separate string in a list
import os
os.path.isfile to check file exist
\n new line
\t tab
in try and except cases, you can use error messages in your except functions (except z)
finally cases are rarely used, but you can use them
except Exception as e is a generic error
